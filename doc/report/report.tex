\chapter{Introduction}
AES encryption is a widely recognized standard encryption that is well used in many modern applications of today. It can be found not only in modern wireless network, but also in encryption devices designed for secure storage as well as in secure wired networks.

It is this group's intention to learn how this encryption works and also how to implement it in FPGA hardware.

\chapter{Definitions}
Before describing the AES encryption, some key definitions need to be mentioned

\subfile{definitions.tex}

\chapter{Theory} \label{sec:theory}
The AES encryption process can be divided in two different sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encryption process
\item Key schedule
\end{itemize}
In encryption process, an unencrypted data packet is encrypted using a cipher key and in key schedule the different round keys needed for the encryption process are generated.

\subfile{encryption_process.tex}

\subfile{key_schedule.tex}

\chapter{Implementation Details}
Approximately each section in chapter \ref{sec:theory} is translated into a separate VHDL entity, and this chapter will follow that structure, but with three additional sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{Resources} Package
\item Encryption Process
\item Key Schedule
\item Top Level Entities
\item Test Benches
\end{itemize}

The \emph{resources} package was created to gather definitions of types, subtypes and components that is used throughout the project. This was done to simplify and generalize all components used.

The section Top Level Entities describes how the different components described in the sections before are interconnected.

In the section Test Benches, the various test benches used to test each component are described.

\section{The resources package}
The VHDL standard defines an elegant way to summarize all different types, subtypes, functions, components, etc. in what is called a \emph{package}. This project have one package for all its parts --- The \emph{resources} package.

This package begins with constants and type definitions, as shown in listing \ref{list:constants} below.

\lstinputlisting[firstline=7,
                 firstnumber=7,
                 lastline=26,
                 label={list:constants},
                 caption={FG\_package.vhd: Constants and type definitions}]
