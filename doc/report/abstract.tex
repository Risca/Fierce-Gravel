The steady incline of valuable and vulnerable data, transferred between an increasing amount of nodes, requires a swift, secure and cost effectively encryption solution to keep the information safe. A dedicated FPGA solution fills these requirements and also; your more valuable components can concentrate on their special abilities.

This project report describes how we implemented AES encryption and decryption routines on a FPGA, written in VHDL. We also present how we used test benches for testing component and subcomponent, to verify all parts of the implementation. This report focuses on the encryption routine, but the full source code implements both encryption and decryption. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/Risca/Fierce-Gravel}.

The result of the project is two fully functional algorithms without any delays other than gate delays. The implementations are easy to expand so they can be implemented in a transmission circuit, or improved by adding, for example, pipelining.
