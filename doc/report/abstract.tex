The steady incline of valuable and vulnerable data, transferred between an increasing amount of nodes, requires a swift, secure and cost effectively encryption solution to keep the information safe. A dedicated FPGA solution fills these requirements and also; your more valuable components can concentrate on their special abilities.

This project report describes how we implemented AES encryption and decryption routines on a FPGA, written in VHDL. We also present how we used test benches for testing implementation components and subcomponents, down to operator level, to verify all parts of the implementations. This report focuses on the encryption routine, but the full source code for both algorithms is posted on \url{https://github.com/Risca/Fierce-Gravel}. The result of the project is two fully functional algorithms without any delays other than gate delays. The implementations made are easy to expand so they can be implemented in a transmission circuit.
